The main task of this step is to create a new view with visual part and control part and a controller to mediate the interactions between the view and the model. 

Therefore, we create a new view called PlaybackView implements View interface, and this view is constructed in EasyAnimator(main) and ViewFactory when command-line use "-view playback". In PlaybackView, showView method takes in the Animation model and the speed and create a PlaybackFrame to be the main window; and addListener method takes in the controller.

PlaybackFrame extends JFrame and implements ActionListener(for JButtons) and ItemListener(for JCheckbox), the main frame is constructed with two parts, visualPanel to show the animation visual view on the left and controlPanel to hold Components(JButtons, JTextArea, JLabel, JComboBox, etc.) to control visualPanel on the right side. Basic control functions(including start, pause, resume, restart, enable/disable looping and change speed) are just controlling the speed and Timer of the visualPanel, so we just add some methods in visualPanel to implement these functions. Advanced control functions( including add, delete, and load) need to change the model, so we add the methods which will change the model in our controller to handle these advanced functions.
